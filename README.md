Sword Coast map updated with general info about locations and campaign specific notes. Oh right: this is about the RPG Dungeons and Dragons...

## Getting Started

Just find the town you want to know more about and if it is clickable you will go to a new page containing the available information on that location and any notes from the campaign sor far. If a location is not clickable then it is either not come up in the campaign yet or we have just not gotten around to updating the info: work in progress.
The index.html contains the hyperlinks to the specific location pages. Each linked location has it's own .html file.
The map.css file contains the map and object coordinates that specify the linked part of the map for each linked location, and ofcourse the layout stuff.

### Prerequisites

Should work on all devices, if not let me know.

## Contributing

The whole D&D party contributes information on locations and campaign notes.

## Versioning

First few versions were uploaded from local files, updates the each file are made within Github and should be traceable via the version history here.
