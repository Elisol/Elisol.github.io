			<h1>Golden Oak</h1></br>
			<!--Generally known info-->
			<h2>General info</h2>
			<p>Fifty miles south of Elventree, there is an oak grove populated with bats, most ordinary, with some azmyths and sinisters. An oak in the grove whose trunk diameter is exactly half the wingspan of a male Elven Court sinister is made of solid gold and disguised as a normal oak, it is thought to be a guard against Tomb Raiders and Robbers. Exactly which oak is not known.<p></br>
			<p>In these depths of the forest of Cormanthor the family of Celephinnor had it's home. Together with two other families they have been guarding the Golden Oak as well as the old Elven Council against dark forces looking for the hidden secrets of what was once one of the most powerful civilications in Faer√ªn. Although they were seen as old-fashioned outsiders to most of the elves that moved to Deepingdale after the collapse of Myth Drannor, they were still held in high regard by the old elite. In this ancient family a young Celephinnor was born and brought up according to traditions and values of old. That is, until the family was banished from the woods by the Elven Council of Deepingdale after his father and uncle were killed in a secret mission for one of the Elven princes. It was when his family left Cormanthor and travelled to friends of his grandfather in the High Forest that they were attacked by drow. Only Celephinnor and his grandfather made a narrow escape.</p>
