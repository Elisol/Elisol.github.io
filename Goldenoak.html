			<!--Generally known info-->
			<h2>General info</h2>
			<p>Fifty miles south of Elventree, there is an oak grove populated with bats, most ordinary, with some azmyths and sinisters. An oak in the grove whose trunk diameter is exactly half the wingspan of a male Elven Court sinister is made of solid gold and disguised as a normal oak, it is thought to be a guard against Tomb Raiders and Robbers. Exactly which oak is not known.<p></br>
			<p>After the destruction of Myth Drannor the elves retreated to the Semberholme area. While most of the forest of Cormanthor is since then a wasteland infested with Drow and other creatures that flourish in the dark rumors exist of small enclaves of wood elves. It is said that these families of elves, named the Golden Oak, made a vow to protect the remains of what was once one of the most powerful civilizations in Faer√ªn. Most elves know them from the tales grandfathers told when the nights were too long, but they are considered a myth. After all, how could any elf survive a place that has become more treacherous than the underdark? </p>
