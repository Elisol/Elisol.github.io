			<p>The depths of the forest of Cormanthor is where the family of Celephinnor had it's home. It's the place where he was born and where he was brought up according to the old traditions and values. At least, until his family was banished from the woods by the Elven council of Myth Drannor after the sudden death of his father and uncle. It was when his family left Cormanthor and travelled to friends of his grandfather in the High Forest that they were attacked by drow. Celephinnor and his grandfather were the only two that survived the attack.</p>
