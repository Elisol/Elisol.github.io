			<!--Feel free to update part below with general info gathered -->
			<p>While travelling from the Evermoors to Phodiff the party stopped here for a week and shopped in the various shops.
			During their stay a disruption in the city prevented inhabitants from travelling between North and South due to a missing bridge control wand, the return of Alustriel seemed to solve this issue.
			They gathered that there is a teleportation circle present in the palace, which can be used by people who can indicate their need to use it (known locations: Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate).
			The found duergar orphan Kellic was brought to an orphanage/school for 'gifted' youngsters.</p>
