			<!--Generally known info-->
			<h2>General info</h2>
			<p>An enormous harbour city-state where you can find both large trading vessels and big battleships being docked. The population of around 120,000 is very diverse in both race and social and economic status, with both the richest noblemen and poorest and sickest of beggars calling it home.<p>
			<p>Baldur's gate is ruled by 4 grand dukes: the Council of Four. The city-state has one of the most powerful armies in the land, and when the high general of this army recently replaced the murdered Duke Portyr in the Council of Four, it just grew even more powerful.</p></br>
