			<h2>General info</h2> <!-- Do not update -->
			<!-- Please fill in below -->
			<p>Phodiff is a small town with 9 large burrows accomodating 9 families. They are mostly dug in and have green doors and windows to be as inconspicuous as possible. This because the area is full of Orcs, Trolls and other dangerous creatures<p>
			<p>The inhabitants lead a calm, quiet life and live of what they grow in their gardens and what they find in the traps they set. Each eldest son of each burrow hunts from time to time, but not very often. The people dress generally in natural colors.<p>
			<p>The town is protected by magic wards</p></br>
